## About OpenDeps

OpenDeps allows you to express your application's _external runtime dependencies_. Using OpenDeps, you use a YAML file to clearly communicate what APIs your software component needs to run correctly.

Formalising your application's runtime dependencies helps improve software quality (e.g. earlier integration testing) and operations (e.g. deployment automation) to help you move faster, safely.

Benefits:
- Verify dependencies are in place before deploying your app
- Rapidly spin up live mocks of all your app's dependencies so you can build/test your app quickly
- Integrates with the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification)
- Language agnostic and cross-platform
- Human readable and machine readable; comprehensible by developers and non-developers
